This repository is a place to put the economics projects I completed during my undergraduate at Trinity College Dublin.
I am also using this to house my own independent projects that I complete while learning new software such as Python. 
Currently included are:
1) My Capstone investigating the causal effect of religion on happiness using a LPM and a novel IV 
2) My advanced econometrics project predicting the UK's Labour Party's success of hitting their macroeconomic targets
3) My econometrics project from 3rd year which investigated if the happiest people in the US were still religious using a ordinal logit
4) A project comparing a signal based trading strategy and a buy-and-hold strategy using the SPY ETF as a predictor.

The first three projects are coded in STATA and compiled in either Latex or Word (.do and .dta files attached).
The fourth project was coded in Python and was a learning exercise as opposed to a full scale project.
